<p class="lead">Lab Measurements</p>

<p>Lab measurements are slightly different from the lab goals. Where the lab goals define what the the purpose and definition
of the lab is, the <strong>measurements</strong> are your definition as to what it means for the lab to have been successful.</p>

<p>Often times defining a measurement of success that can actually be measured is difficult. Do your best to determine outcomes and,
preferably, metrics that will define success.</p>

<p>An example may be: <i>replace at least 10 automated emails with OpenNMS events and notifications</i></p>
