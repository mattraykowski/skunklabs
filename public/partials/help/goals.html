<p class="lead">Lab Goals</p>
<p>Your lab goals should be realistic. Here are some good guidelines on defining your goals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goals should describe each bit of high level functionality that should be implemented.</li>
  <li>Goals should <strong>not</strong> define a timeline.</li>
  <li>Goals should state some desired impact - organizationally or within a team.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Remember!</strong> You don't have to complete an entire 'product' in a single lab. Think agile and break your desired product
  up into digestable labs.</p><p>This means your lab is both achievable and allows you to reflect back on the successes and failures of the lab
  and make a reasonable determination of future goals for the overall product. You might even want to just stop developing the product.</p>
